        "description": "An introduction to problem-solving via programming, which aims to have students develop proficiency in using a high level programming language. Topics: algorithms, program structures (statements, sequence, selection, iteration, functions), data types (numeric, character), data structures (arrays, tuples, pointers, lists), storage structures (memory, addresses), introduction to analysis of algorithms, testing, code quality, teamwork, and reflective practice. The course includes extensive practical work in labs and programming projects.",

        "description": "This course provides a programmer's view on how a computer system executes programs, manipulates data and communicates. It enables students to become effective programmers in dealing with issues of performance, portability, and robustness. It is typically taken in the term after completing COMP1511, but could be delayed and taken later. It serves as a foundation for later courses on networks, operating systems, computer architecture and compilers, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required.",

It also introduces the basic notions of team-based project management via conducting a project to design, build and deploy a simple web-based application. It is typically taken in the term after completing COMP1511, but could be delayed and taken later. It provides essential background for the teamwork and project management required in many later courses.",

We anticipate that it will generally be taken in the second year of a program, but since its only pre-requisite is COMP1511, is it possible to take it in first year. It is an important course in covering a range of core data structures and algorithms that will be used in context in later courses.",
